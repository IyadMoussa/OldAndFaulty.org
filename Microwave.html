  <h1 style="text-align: center; color: white;">3. Microwave.</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center; color: white;"">it is possible for them to leak electromagnetic radiation. The proces of how it happens:
    Absorption by Water Molecules, Heat Transfer to Surrounding Food so this is how the Electro magnetic radiation happens.
    Overall, in a microwave oven, the dominant heat transfer mechanism is electromagnetic radiation, specifically microwaves, which directly heat the water molecules in the food. This is what distinguishes microwave cooking from other cooking methods such as conventional ovens, where heat is transferred primarily through conduction and convection.</p>
