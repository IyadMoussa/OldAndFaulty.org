<h1>1. Energy Ineffiency</h1>
    <p>Older refrigerators tend to be less energy efficient compared to newer models, resulting in higher electricity bills.</p>
<p>While convection also plays a role in heat transfer within the refrigerator and between the refrigerator and its surroundings, it's typically not the primary factor contributing to energy inefficiency in refrigerators. ⬅️so this the covection or radiation or conduction part </p>
<h1>Odor Accumulation</h1>
<p>Bacteria and mold can accumulate in neglected areas of the refrigerator, leading to unpleasant odors that can transfer to stored food items.</p>
<p>What allows odours to become a problem in a refrigerator is convection, but to a lesser extent conduction. The etymology of the term ‘convection’ is apt for recognising the likelihood that it is responsible for odour accumulation in the fridge: it refers to circulation. Convection occurs when particles in a warm portion of a fluid become lighter and move away from the centre of the warm space toward the colder parts of the fluid. Dense counterparts of the particles from the warmer centre of a fluid move towards the light, warm particles. Therefore, as air circulates in a refrigerator, odours attributed to offish, rotting eggs, or the ghosts of orange juice spills will start moving and get dispersed throughout the interior of the fridge.</p>
