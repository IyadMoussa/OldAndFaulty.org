<h1 style="color: white;">1. The Air Conditioner</h1>
<p style="color: white;">The Air Conditioner is a household machine that can pump out hot air, and pump in cold air! -Convection because convection is the transfer of heat through the movement of fluids (such as air or water). In this problem, the AC unit heats the air inside by extracting heat from the outdoor air and then circulating the warmed air indoors</p>

<h2 style="color: white;">The Risks</h2>
<p style="color: white;">The risks of a old, or faulty Air Conditioner can be very major! It is needed to be dealt with as soon as possible.</p>
<h1 style="color: white;">Headaches:</h1>
<p style="color: white;">Because of old A.C., headaches is the common.
Because of things like Poor Air Quality, Dry Air, Temperature Fluctuations.
Poor Air Quality: Old air conditioners may accumulate dust, mold, and other contaminants over time, especially if they are not properly maintained. Breathing in these particles can irritate the respiratory system and lead to headaches.
Dry Air: Air conditioners, especially older models, can remove moisture from the air, leading to dry indoor air. This dryness can cause dehydration, which may manifest as headaches in some individuals.
Temparature Fluctuations:  Older air conditioners may have less precise temperature control or may cool the air too rapidly, causing temperature fluctuations in the environment. Sudden changes in temperature can trigger headaches in some people.
-headaches from old air conditioners can be caused by factors such as poor air quality, dry air, and temperature fluctuations. The cooling process primarily involves convection and conduction, with a small contribution from radiation.
Therefore, headaches from old air conditioners can be attributed to factors related to convection (e.g., poor air quality, temperature fluctuations) and conduction (e.g., dry air causing dehydration), rather than radiation.</p>

<h1 style="color: white;">Refrigerant Leaks</h1>
<p style="color: white;">So the problem, is that the coolant strats to leak in the ac.
And the unit will not work properly and the temperature(temp) and the part where it leaked will affect the cost of the repair.
refrigerant leaks in AC systems primarily involve heat transfer through convection (as the refrigerant gas moves through the air) and conduction (as heat is conducted between the refrigerant and surrounding materials).</p>
